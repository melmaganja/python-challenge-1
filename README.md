# python-challenge-1

Purpose of the assignment:## Using Python to build a code that allows customers to place an order and print a receipt.

Applications used: VS Code and Github

What I learned: I applied my basic knowledge of Python to complete this activity. I used my understanding of Strings, Integers and Booleans throughout this assignment. In addition, I applied my knowledge of For Loops, Dictionaries and Keys to build my application. 

My challenges: Personally, I found this assignment extremely difficult. I had to utilize all my resources extensively to complete the code. I struggled with grasping the concepts that we learned less than a week ago. I believe that this assignment should have been a task we completed later in the course, when we had more time to apply our skills. However, I am now aware of the areas that I need improvement on. I will continue to push through these challenges to the best of my ability.
